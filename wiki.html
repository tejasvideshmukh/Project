    <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
    <h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
    <hr>
    <p><b><u>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)</u></b>was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial
         nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful 
         campaign for India's independence from British rule and in turn inspired movements for civil 
         rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), 
        first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.

            <h1>Early life:</h1>
<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh
    Bania family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and
     then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire.
      His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.
     Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state 
    administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Three years in London:</h1>
<p>Gandhi came from a poor family, and he had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford.
    Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should 
    consider law studies in London.In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son,
     Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far 
     from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. </p>

<h1>Death:</h1>
<p>
    30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House 
    (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist,
     fired three bullets into his chest from a pistol at close range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly.In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of 
    Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.
